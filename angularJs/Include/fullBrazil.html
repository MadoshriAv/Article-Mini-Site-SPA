                <br/><br/>Most of Brazil’s all-inclusive resorts are an easy flight from Rio, clustered in beach towns in popular destinations like Porto de Galinhas in Recife and Bahia’s Praia do Forte.

                        They range from sprawling beachfront hotels near sleepy fishing villages to secluded properties on coral reef-fringed islands. They may all offer guests endless eating, drinking, and activities, but there’s nothing cookie-cutter about these seven resorts.<br/><br/>   If you’re heading to Brazil, check into one of these places and enjoy beach life without worrying about anything (except maybe how well you applied your sunscreen).<br/><br/><br/> International visitors tend to overlook the Brazilian state of Ceará and its capital city Fortaleza, opting to hit the beaches in Recife or Trancuso instead. It’s a shame because Ceará, tucked into Brazil’s northeast corner, is filled with fishing villages and spectacular beaches lined with red cliffs that are definitely worth a visit. For those interested in exploring a new corner of the country, Vila Galé’s Combuco outpost is a great option, combining the ease of all-inclusive travel with the excitement of a new locale. Combuco, about 15 miles from Fortaleza, is a beach surrounded by turquoise waters and wind-swept sand dunes. The massive beach hotel, which has over 400 rooms and 49 chalets, has three restaurants, three bars, and plenty of activities from tennis to yoga, kite-boarding, and (of course) dune buggy rides.<br/><br/>  The sprawling Iberostar resort sits on the pristine Praia do Forte in Bahia. The hotel has over 500 rooms spread throughout the various buildings on the property. From Iberostar, guests can access the aquamarine waters of the Atlantic Ocean, or enjoy the complex of swimming pools (the kids’ pool will blow some minds). There’s also a golf course, tennis courts, and restaurants and bars. Included in your fee are a full roster of fitness classes, including aerobics, water polo, and dance. For those looking to explore more of Bahia’s natural wonders, the hotel is near the Atlantic forest, and close to some of Bahia’s best beaches; many of which serve as nesting grounds for sea turtles and offer views of Humpback whales.<br/><br/><br/>    Visiting Iguaçu Falls, an awe-inspiring waterfall to see before you die, is a once-in-a-lifetime adventure. The massive natural wonder is comprised of 275 individual terraced falls surrounded by a tropical forest and the Parques das Aves (Bird Park), where visitors can easily pass an entire day. At the end of the trek, collapse into bed—or a geothermal pool—at nearby Mabu Thermas Grand Resort. The resort is built on one of the biggest hot springs on the planet, the Guarani Aquifer, which refills the pools every few hours with water naturally warmed to 96 degrees. People from all over the world come to soak in its medicinal waters. In addition to the geothermal wonder and proximity to the UNESCO World Heritage site, Mabu offers guests access to a spa, a club for kids, restaurants and bars, and activities like biking, zip lines, and rock climbing.
