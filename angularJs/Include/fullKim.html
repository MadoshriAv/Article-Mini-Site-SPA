                    The North Korean leader struck an unusually conciliatory note in his annual New Year's Day address Monday, declaring his hope for (a) peaceful resolution with our southern border.<br/>													In the televised address, Kim called for peace on the Korean peninsula and said North Korean representatives should start talks with their South Korean counterparts as soon as possible to discuss sending a delegation to the 2018 Winter Games, to be hosted in South Korea next month.	<br/><br/>																									Moon, who has long advocated for closer relations with the North, described Kim's remarks as a response to our proposal to turn the Pyeongchang Olympic Games into an epoch-making opportunity to improve inter-Korean relations and establish peace.<br/>			Moon said he would ask the Unification Ministry <br/><br/>-- the government department responsible for inter-Korean relations <br/><br/>-- and the Ministry of Culture and Sports to quickly come up with follow-up measures for the speedy restoration of 		 				South-North Korean dialogue and realize the North Korean delegation's participation in the Pyeongchang Olympics.
