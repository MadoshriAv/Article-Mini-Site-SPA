                Warmly ensconced in the bleached hide of Falkor, the golden diva and the two full-sized Tiffany chandeliers hanging from her ears wailed us into the New Year. There was confetti and sparkly nude illusion dresses and a little gospel choir and expert vocalization. It was all very on-brand. <br/><br/>																					 																																							But perhaps nothing was more on-brand than when Mariah paused between songs to ask for some hot tea.<br/><br/>									 																																												They told me there would be tea she said, looking perplexed. Despite the hellish cold of the evening, there was not.<br/><br/>					 																																											Oh, it's a disaster. Okay, well, we'll just have to rough it. I'm going to be like everybody else, with no hot tea.
