                <h4>
                        Known as Las Pe√±as in the 1800s, it was renamed after former state governor Ignacio Vallarta in the early 1900s. As a fishing town, Puerto Vallarta's main source of pesos, in addition to fishing, was agricultural exports such as bananas, coconuts and corn. These days, it relies on importing tourists, hypnotized by the green turquoise seawater.<br/><br/>
                        Blame Hollywood. Stars such as Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor and Ava Gardner descended on Banderas Bay to film John Huston's "The Night of the Iguana." Soon enough, the paparazzi caught whiff of Taylor and Burton's blossoming love affair with each other -- and their new second home. Others followed suit, including investors.<br/><br/><br/>
                        Flash-forward several decades later and cue the mariachi bands that tame tourists with exotic festive sounds, all-inclusive resorts with sandy beaches and watered-down drinks. But the Puerto Vallarta that Burton and Taylor in fell with is so much more, if only you look beyond the confines of your resort when you travel here.
