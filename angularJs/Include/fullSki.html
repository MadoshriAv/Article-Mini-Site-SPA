            <h4>
                The 24-year-old German clinched only the second podium finish of his career with a storming run down the infamous Streif course in front of the 45,000-strong crowd intent on turning the pretty Austrian resort into a carnival for this iconic weekend of ski racing. <br/><br/>  The Kitzbuhel track is notoriously difficult with huge jumps, such as the 80-meter Mausefalle not long after the steep start section, and fast, bumpy, technical sections such as the Steilhang. <br/><br/> High-speed crashes have been a notable feature of the race over the years. <br/><br/>   "The most important victory for a downhiller is Kitzbuhel because in my opinion it's the most complete race," Austrian legend Franz Klammer, the 1976 Olympic downhill champion, told CNN Sport. <br/><br/><br/>    "It requires everything: guts, making tight turns, long turns, gliding sections and jumping."
